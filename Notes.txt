Apache POI API is used to access Microsoft format files.
In order to access data from the Excel sheet we need to add Apache POI jar files or dependencies to the project
This is an open source library that helps to access data from the excel sheet.
ADD Dependencies:
1)First add apache poi-ooxml dependency
2)Next add apache Poi dependency
These "poi-ooxml" and "poi" dependencies are important to extract data from excel
STRATEGIES TO ACCESS THE EXCEL DATA:
-> Create an object XSSFWorkbook class.
-> Get access to sheet in excel file
-> Get access to all rows of sheet.
-> Get access to specific row from all rows
-> Access data from excel to arrays
PROCEDURE:
1)First get the desired excel file path and cover that path to fileinputstream as follows
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("C//...filepath");
2)Create a XSSFWorkbook instance and pass the file input stream to it's class.
XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(inputFile);
3)Now get access to the specific sheet that contains the required data and store it in sheet varible
In order to do this get the total sheet count of the file and loop through the file using the count'
int numberOfSheets = workbook.getNumberOfSheets();
       for (int i=0;i>0;i++){
           if(workbook.getSheetName(i).equalsIgnoreCase("Sales-2022")) {
               XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(i);

           }
->Use getSheetName(int sheetsindex) to get the sheet name by passing the index of sheet
->Use getSheetAt(int sheetsindex) to get access to sheet by using the index of sheet
4)Now get the access to the column from the sheet that contains the required data
for example: There is a sales data file ,and you want to get details of whoever bought a cellphone.
->For this access the row where the column names present then
->locate the column with the name "items" which contains the cellphone value.
TO do this iterate through the rows of the sheet using java Iterator class
                Iterator<Row> rows = sheet.iterator();
               Row firstRow = rows.next();
               firstRow.ite
